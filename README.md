Hello there,
This is my first prokect with HTML and CSS. I have actually learned a lot using the Odin Project. 
    1. Setting up a repository with GitHub
    2. Creating files through the terminal 
    3. Opening up VS code through terminal 
These are just a few things I have learned. Hopefully by the end of this mini project, I will know so much more.
